## About Me

I have been creative for as long as I can remember. From an early age I was a musician and liked to perform on stage. I was not limited to performance as a creative outlet however - finding creativity in technical drawing, CAD and ultimately programming from the age of 11 onwards.

These days I am still a nerd but a father first. I like to make time for my family and enjoy walking, camping, cycling and adventures.

When I have spare time I take music lessons (currently my instrument is drums). In my downtime I like to read and I watch a lot of film and TV.

In between all this I try to commit 30 minutes a day to elevating my heart rate! My current exercise passion is running and swimming.
